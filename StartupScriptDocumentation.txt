Run InstallStartupScript.py to install RunCheckScripts.bat on startup.

The batch file RunCheckScripts.bat will run on startup, and when asked to makes changes to your device, should be allowed.

RunCheckScripts.bat periodically checks that the local MongoDB server and keylogger programs are running, and starts them if they are not running.
